You Suck At Remembering Your Schedule.


Sinopsis
--------

WIP migration of  https://github.com/thiago-negri/zvenc  to C89.


Why?
----

Because Zig is fun but it's not released yet and I don't want to keep
maintaining this to work around breaking changes to the language.

C89* means this will run forever on any piece of hardware I have with minimal
maintenance.

*  C89 with a 64 bit integer type.
